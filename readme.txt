Full Name: Roxana D Vasile
Email Address: roxanavasile91@gmail.com
Tested Browsers: Chrome
Libraries Used: jQuery, Bootstrap 
Source Files: 
1. blog.html - landing page
2. readme.txt - simple instructions
3. js - all js files (since I used a link for the jQuery, I didn't download the minified version and built on top of the provided layout) , in this case just one: scripts.js
4. css - folder to contain all .css files, in this case just one: styles.css

IMPORTANT: The edit button for each blog post is not working. I would have liked to add a notification to let the editor know, but I ran out of time. 

I also wished I had a cancel button next to the "Submit" Button. 

I hope you will like my web app!
